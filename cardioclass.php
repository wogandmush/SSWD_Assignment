  <!-- Section description font-weight-bolder-->
  <p class="lead grey-text text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">This is a full body interval training programme that burns the maximum number of calories. It is suitable for people with a moderate fitness level and incorporates exercises such as high knees, march twists, upper cuts and knee-to-elbows. And you don’t need to have any prior experience in martial arts to join in.

Cardio class at Perfect Form Fitness is an alternative cardio exercise that teaches you how to kick, jab and clinch in a non-contact environment. It’s a fast paced class that keeps your heart racing and really makes you sweat. Classes can be quite intense so we recommend you take it at your own pace and build endurance over time.

At the end of each Cardio session you will leave exhausted but feeling great. Complete beginners will feel the burn for a few days after their first few sessions. This challenging mix of martial arts and cardio is a great way to unleash your inner strength! </p>
