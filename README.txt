*pages which include connect.php more than once raise errors
 - I propose using a DBConnect class with static method getConnection to 
get a connection variable instead.
e.g.
 
$conn = DBConnect::getConnection();

//db logic

mysqli_close($conn);

*connect.php should just define constants required for connection
<?php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_USER', 's2995020');
define('DB_PWD', 'yourpassword');
define('DB_NAME', 'yourdbname');
?>


*Copy template.php when creating a new file*

    ----Web Application Requirements----

 - Handle form data in a secure manner e.g. use HTML and PHP validation techniques when handling user input

 - Make the website look professional by using good CSS techniques (frameworks) and appropriate content

 - Your HTML, CSS, and PHP code should be original and commented. You may be asked to explain any piece of code. Failure to understand and explain code may be taken as evidence of plagarism. You may use frameworks such as bootstrap. All HTML and CSS should be validated

 - PHP code should be modular e.g. include several header and footer files as opposed to copying and pasting the same code to several pages

 - The home page of the site should be called index.php

 - Your website should follow best practice in terms of security
 
 - Store its data in a MySQL database

 - Connection to the database should be made using one file (e.g. connect.php)
 
 - Database table names shoudl be singular e.g. user not users.
