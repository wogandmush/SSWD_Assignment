  <!-- Section description -->
  <p class="lead grey-text text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">There are a variety of yoga styles, with a class to suit everyone’s abilities. Hatha yoga is a gentler style but can be quite challenging. Longer poses help to relieve tension in the body. As well as loosen your body and strengthen the muscles. In contrast, Vinyasa flow is a yoga style that moves at a faster pace focusing on the flow between the movements rather than individual poses. And Bikram yoga is a style suited to more experienced yogis. As this class takes place in a 42 °C heated studio. Therefore, it’s best to try out different styles before deciding which is right for you.</p>
